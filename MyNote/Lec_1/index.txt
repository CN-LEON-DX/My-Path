// 

+ Keywords (SELECT, FROM, WHERE) are case-insensitive.
+ Table and column names are case-insensitive if 
    unquoted but case-sensitive if double-quoted.
+ String literals ('Seattle', 'seattle') are case-sensitive.
+ Single quotes ' ' are for string literals, while double quotes 
    " " are for identifiers (like column or table names) and enforce 
    case sensitivity.

EX:
SELECT * FROM city WHERE name = 'Seattle';  -- Finds rows where name is 'Seattle'
SELECT * FROM city WHERE name = 'seattle';  -- Finds rows where name is 'seattle' (not the same as 'Seattle')

SELECT * FROM city WHERE name ILIKE 'seattle';  -- Case-insensitive comparison

SELECT 'abc';    -- This is a constant/literal, so it will return 'abc'
SELECT "abc";    -- This is treated as an identifier. PostgreSQL will look for a column or table named `abc`
